//To find combinations instead of permutations
//we need to move the index by one for every next iteration/ new coin to be considered
//Codebix soln v good explanation
/*
Suppose the amount is 5
and we have an array of [1,2,5]
if 2 is considered
then amount will become 5-2 = 3
now to get 3 , we should use coins only from 2nd index
i.e. 2 and 5
coin at index 1 will be ignored
