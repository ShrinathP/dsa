Tushary roy DP solution
=======================
If there is a ? question mark
then there can be any 1 character 
eg a?b = axb

If there is a star 
then there can be one or more characters 
a*b = aksdjfwb

We have iterators
i is the iterator for the given string
j is the iterator for the given pattern

Condition 1
if str[i] = pattern[j] OR pattern[j] == ? (question mark)
Then consider T[i-1][j-1] value

Condition 2
if pattern of j is a star
T[i][j] = T[i-1][j] ||  T[i][j-1]
