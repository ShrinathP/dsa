// 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times
// Given an array of positive integers arr, find if a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.

/*
To detect k consecutive repetitions of a pattern of length m, we need to find (k-1) × m consecutive matches. 
Why (k-1) × m and not k × m? Because:
- The first occurrence of the pattern takes up m elements
- Each additional repetition requires m more matching elements
- So for k total repetitions, we need the first m elements plus (k-1) × m matching elements

*/

class Solution {
    //explanation naresh, chgp
    public boolean containsPattern(int[] arr, int m, int k) {
        //m length, k times
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i < arr.length - m; i++) {
            //Compare current element with the one m steps ahead
            if(arr[i] == arr[i+m]) {
                count++;
                //If we have (k-1)*m consecutive matches, return true
                if(count==(k-1)*m) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                //no use of all that counts as there is some mismatch
                //reset count to 0
                count=0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

/*
How It Works:
- Instead of comparing full chunks repeatedly, it compares elements at distance m.

- If the element at i is the same as i + m, it contributes to a repeated pattern.

- To form a pattern of length m repeated k times, we need (k - 1) * m such matching pairs.

- The counter resets on a mismatch.
