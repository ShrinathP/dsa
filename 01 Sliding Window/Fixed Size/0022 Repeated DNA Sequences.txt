/*
Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, 
return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. 


two problems are different.

Detect Pattern checks k CONSECUTIVE repeats of a block (element-wise). Your arr[i] == arr[i+m] works since elements are atomic and you count (k-1)*m consecutive matches → boolean.

Repeated DNA Sequences asks for all distinct 10-char substrings that occur ≥2 times ANYWHERE (not necessarily consecutive) → you must identify substrings, not just detect a run.
