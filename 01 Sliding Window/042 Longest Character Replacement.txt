    Sliding window Problem
    We need to keep track of a window
    1. window should have at max K characters other than the repeating character
    (as only K operations are allowed)
    
    Steps
    1. Create a frequency array
    - Max count - to keep track of the maximum count of the repeating character
    - Distinct character other than repeating character
    - window size - repeating char count
    i.e. window_end - winodow_start - max_count
    - if it exceeds K, move the start ahead
    2. Calculate max_length, which will be max window size

            //** find the number of distinct characters (other than the repeating character)
            //Formula = window_end - window_start - max_count + 1
            //window_end - window_start this is the range
            //max_count is max number of repeating characters
            //1 is for increasing the window by adding new elmenets
