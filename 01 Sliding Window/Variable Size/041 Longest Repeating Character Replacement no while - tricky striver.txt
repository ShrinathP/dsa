//IMP: do not aggressive trim using while loop, if an answer lets say length 5 satisfies, then move ahead the same length 5

424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
// We are removing the while loop to trim the left pointer continuously 
//We only trim by 1, so effectively keeping the max length same if not satisfied
//if r-l+1 was the largest substring in one of the previous iterations
//we move both l and r by 1 keeping length same
//eliminating need of while loop

//using maxLen to save max length

Make sure that
the size of the window minus the count of the most frequent character does not exceed k
1. hold count of the most frequent character
2. if more replacment than k needed, shave of one from the left
3. calculate maxLen
