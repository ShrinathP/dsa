Keep holding prefixsum and its occurences in HashMap
keep adding sum
When you reach a point where you have a PrefixSum (sum - k) occurence present
then the answer is 
sum(k) = (PrefixSum(sum) - PrefixSum(sum - k))

number of ways = freq of sum-k, occurences

at every point,
- calculate the presum map, 
- In the hashmap, if present increase the count, if not add 1
- if there is a complementary sum, present already in the hashmap, add the count (of complementary sums) to result

The hashmap is to record presum and frequency of the presum. The reason why result += map.get(sum-k) is when at each sum if there is a presum exists then there is a subarray between this sum and presum. But to use its frequency instead of just add 1 to result is because there can be multiple presum exists at this point of sum. Since each presum is added up from beginning there can be no two duplicate presum and therefore no two duplicate subarrays exist.
