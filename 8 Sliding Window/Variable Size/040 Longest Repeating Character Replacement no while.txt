424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
// We are removing the while loop to trim the left pointer continuously 
//We only trim by 1, so effectively keeping the max length same if not satisfied
//if r-l+1 was the largest substring in one of the previous iterations
//we move both l and r by 1 keeping length same
//eliminating need of while loop



class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int[] cnt = new int[26];
        int l = 0, mx = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
            mx = Math.max(mx, ++cnt[s.charAt(r) - 'A']);
