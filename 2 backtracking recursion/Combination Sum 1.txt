Here we need to find a combination of arrays where
***a number can be used any number of times***

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, 
return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times


===========================
as we can pick the number any number of times
After adding to tempList ,
backtrack through the same index
eg
tempList.add(nums[i])
backtrack(i, target-nums[i], tempList, result)

instead of
backtrack(i+1, target-nums[i], tempList, result)


Time complexity , if you had picked only 
once a time
(2 power N ) * k where N is length of String
and k is is average length of combination generated

----
(2 power t )*k where k is average length of combination generated

----------
Pick and non pick way
