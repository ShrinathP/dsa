/*
* Maximize the minimum distance between cows - they are aggressive

- Maximize the minimum distance between any two cows.
Aggressive Cows is a maximize–minimum problem on integers,
Minimize Max Gas Distance is a minimize–maximum problem on reals.

Because of this, the meaning of high is different, even though both use binary search.
high is the largest possible minimum distance you could ever hope for.
Put one cow at the first stall
Put another cow at the last stall

Gas Station Problem
Minimize the maximum distance between adjacent stations.
So search variable
D = maximum allowed gap


Problem Understanding
You have n stalls at different positions (represented by an array).
You have k aggressive cows.
The goal is to place the cows in the stalls such that the smallest distance between any two cows is maximized. 

Strategy
Compute low and high
int low = 1;
int high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0];


For each distance mid, check:
Is it possible to place k cows with at least mid distance apart?
If yes → try for a bigger distance (low = mid + 1)
If no → reduce distance (high = mid - 1)

Time complexity
Binary Search: O(log(max distance))
Each feasibility check (canPlaceCows) is O(n)
Total: O(n log(max distance))
