Leetcode 1011 – Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days
Find the minimum ship capacity such that all packages can be shipped within D days.
Packages must be shipped in order, and a ship cannot carry more than its capacity in a day.

Low - Minimum capacity of the ship should be the maximum of the individual packages otherwise the package wont be shipped
So minimum ship size is max(nums)
High - Max is total sum of all packages - can be shipped in 1 shot - 1 day

Monotonic Property:
Higher capacity → fewer days required
✅ So we can apply binary search on capacity.

🔍 Logic Flow:
1️⃣ We try to pack as many packages into each day as possible
2️⃣ As soon as adding the next package exceeds capacity, we start a new day
3️⃣ Finally, we verify if total days used ≤ D

public class Solution {

    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int low = 0, high = 0;

        for (int w : weights) {
            low = Math.max(low, w);    // Ship capacity should be - At least max of all weights - 
            high += w;                 // and At most sum of all weights
        }

        int ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canShip(weights, D, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1; // try smaller capacity
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;  // need larger capacity
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    // Helper to check if capacity is sufficient
    private boolean canShip(int[] weights, int D, int capacity) {
        int days = 1, currentLoad = 0;
        // If adding this package exceeds today's capacity:

        for (int w : weights) {
            if (currentLoad + w > capacity) {
                days++; // Need an extra day
                currentLoad = 0; // Start fresh for the new day
            //new day, new load
            }
                    // Keep adding current package to today's load
            currentLoad += w;
        }

    // After processing all packages, check if we stayed within allowed D days
        return days <= D;
    }
