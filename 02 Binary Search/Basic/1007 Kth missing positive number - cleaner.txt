/*
at every point compute missing number, if less move right half, if more move left half

chatgpt solution, algoritms made easy explanation - 

why are we adding k at last ?
After binary search
Those left elements occupy left natural numbers

👉 The kth missing number is:
answer = left (present numbers) + k (missing numbers)
To get the kth missing number, skip left existing numbers and k missing ones.

Small Example
arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
After binary search:
left = 4   // 4 array elements are before the answer
Natural numbers covered:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
      ↑ missing count = 5
answer = left + k = 4 + 5 = 9

class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1);

            if (missing < k)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        return left + k;
    }
}
