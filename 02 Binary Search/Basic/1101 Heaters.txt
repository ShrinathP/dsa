//chatgpt explanation of left - 1
/*
Your binary search finds:
the first heater whose value is ≥ house

Meaning:
heaters[left] is the first heater to the right of the house
(or exactly at the house).
heaters[left − 1] is the heater immediately to the left.
To find the closest heater, you must compare both sides.
