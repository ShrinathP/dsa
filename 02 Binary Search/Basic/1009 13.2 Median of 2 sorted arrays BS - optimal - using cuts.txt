//chatgpt explanation
For odd total length
total = 7
sorted = [a b c | d | e f g]
median would be 7/2 = 3 - does not include median on left size
7 / 2 = 3   ❌ median falls on right side
with + 1; 
(7 + 1) / 2 = 4 elements  ← includes median on left side

For Even total length
sorted = [a b c d | e f g h]
median would be 8/2 = 4 - has the median on left side
For even total length:
(n1 + n2) / 2 == (n1 + n2 + 1) / 2
So +1 makes NO difference for even cases.

One-line intuition
LEFT always contains the median position.

thats why 
leftSize = (n1 + n2 + 1) / 2;
cut1 + cut2 = leftSize (we need (n1 + n2 + 1)/2) elements on the leftSize
cut2 = leftSize - cut1

Scalar Notes
            //condition satisfied   	M = [ a  | b]  
//					N = [ c  | d]
//Property of the median // a < d and c < b
Imp keep 1st array smaller, as we are doing BS on 1st array only




Step 1.
Binary Search on Smalllest length array
Step 2. 
find 2 cuts, mid and (N + M + 1) /2

#Logic of cut locations - cut2
cut2 is half of total length minus the elements taken in cut1
so cut2 = (n1 + n2)/2 - cut1


Step 3. Put cuts to find left half and right half of the arr1 using cut1
Step 4. Put cuts to find left half and right half of the arr2 using cut2

5. Check condition, if left1 < right2 and left2 < right1, satisfied then find median
	5.1 (check lengths if n1+n2 is even median is avg of lowest of lefts and higest of rights)
else if left1 > right2, move hi back, else move low ahead

TC - we are doing BS on smaller array so O(log(min(N, M)))
