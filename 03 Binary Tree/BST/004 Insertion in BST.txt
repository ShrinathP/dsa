Striver explanation - 
There can be multiple possibilities of insertion 

/*
Original BST before inserting 5:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \   
    1   3   

After inserting node 5: (at root)
        5
       / \
      4   7
     /
    2
   / \
  1   3

After inserting node 5 between 4 and 7:
        4
       / \
      2   5
     / \   \
    1   3   7

After inserting node 5 on left of 7:
         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3  5

Explanation:
Can  be multiple way in which we can insert 5

Logic
Find where the node could have been- 
There will always be some leaf position
IMP - If not null keep moving on left or right based on key value

🧠 Logic:
1. Traverse the BST:
    If key < node → go left.
    If key > node → go right.
2. Insert at the first null child.

1. If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it as root.
2. Start from the root.
3. Compare the value to insert (val) with the current node:
        - If val < current.val, move to the left subtree.
        - Else, move to the right subtree.
4. Repeat until you find a null position.
5. Insert the new node at that position.
6. Return the original root.

✅ Time Complexity (TC)
For inserting a node into a BST, time depends on the height h:
In a balanced BST, h = log₂(n).
So TC = O(log n) in balanced case.
In worst-case (skewed tree), h = n, so TC = O(n).

SC = O(1)
