ðŸ§© Problem Summary:
- There are n children standing in a line, and each child has a rating value.
- You need to distribute candies such that:
  1. Each child gets at least 1 candy.
  2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
- The task is to find the minimum number of candies required to distribute to the children.

âœ… Greedy Approach:
1. Two passes through the ratings:
  - First pass (left to right): Ensure children with higher ratings get more candies than their left neighbor.
  - Second pass (right to left): Ensure children with higher ratings get more candies than their right neighbor, and adjust the candies from the first pass if necessary.
2. Why two passes?:
  - The first pass ensures that we correctly handle increasing sequences.
  - The second pass ensures that we handle decreasing sequences while adjusting the candies given to children when needed.
