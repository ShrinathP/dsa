keep moving back and check when reducing trend breaks
Find largest index i such that str[i – 1] < str[i].

From j = i-1, move ahead
Find a j which is just less than equal to i
Find largest index j such that j >= i and str[j] < str[i – 1].
Swap str[j] and str[i – 1].
Reverse the sub-array starting at str[i].
