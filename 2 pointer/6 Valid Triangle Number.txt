/* cue - for loop from i=2 and 2 pointers on left section

To check if its a valid triangle we need to check if
sum of 2 shorter sides is greater than 3rd side
(Iteration + binary search)
Steps
1. Sort the array in ascending order
2. Maintain 3 variables
i for the iterator
left and right for the values on the left of the iterator
3. Start iterating from index 2
4. if sum is greater than i, then add subtraction of indices of i and left to the result
BECAUSE ALL THE NUMBERS BETWEEN LEFT AND I CAN ALSO BE USED WITH I(right) TO FORM THE TRIANGLE
AS ARRAY IS SORTED ALL ELEMENTS bETWEEN LEFT AND i ARE GREATER THAN LEFT
 AND keep moving right back


[2,3,4,5,6,7] if number is 5 2,3,4 with 5, then right --, then 2,3 with 4
