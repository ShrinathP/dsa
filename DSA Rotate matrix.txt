Rotate matrix by 90 degrees

Easy approach 
Using one extra matrix
1. Use first row put it in the last column
2. Use 2nd row and put it in 2nd last column
...
Time complexity O(N2)
Space complexity O(N2)


Optimal approach 
to do this in place
1. Transpose the given matrix 
Columns will becoe rows and rows will become columns
		OUTPUT
1 2 3		7 4 1
4 5 6  - >  	8 5 2
7 8 9  		9 6 3

After transpose
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9

2. You need to reverse each row numbers to get the OUTPUT
using 2 pointer method (imp)

Time complexity 
O(n2) to transpose + O(n2) to reverse ~ O(n2)
Space complexity
O(1) as we are doing it in place
