Nodes/Vertices
Edges
Directed / Non Directed Graph
Directed Cyclic Graph
Path - each of the nodes should be reachable
Degree of Node - the number of edges that come into or go outside of the Node

For Undirected Graph
Total degree of a graph is equal to twice the number of edges - as every edge is connected to 2 nodes

For Directed Graph
Indegree(node) - incoming edges
Outdegree(node) - outgoing edges

Edge weights - 
All edges can have some weights assigned
