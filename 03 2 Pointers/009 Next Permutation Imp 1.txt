Striver explanation 
Algorithms made easy explanation

1 3 5 4 2 example
1. Traverse from the back and find an index which breaks increasing sequence i
2. Traverse from the back and find an index just greater than nums[i]
3. swap (a[i], a[j])
4. reverse everything from (index1+1 to last)


Find the NEXT PERMUTATION of 132

123
132
213
231
312
321

Brute Method
- In Brute method you need to arrange
1. GEnerate all possible combos
2. Linearly Iterate and check

Time Complexity 
N! *N
Because there are N! orders and N is the length of every array


//Optimal Approach
Linear Time Complexity

Steps
1 3 5 4 2 example
From back when the increasing sequence breaks, save as index1
1. Traverse from the back and find an index 1 where a[i] < a[i + 1]
Find the index to be swapped index2
2. Traverse from the back and find an index 2 where a[index2] > a[index1]
3. swap (a[index1], a[index2])
4. reverse everything from (index1+1 to last)


Intitution behind the algorithm
is that in every next permutation there is an ascending number train from right to left
like 

2-4-5 increasing sequence
13542

Time Complexity
===============
O(n) + O(n)//2times travel backward + O(n) //reverse


class Solution {
	public void nextPermutation(int[] A){
//removing null A and A length 1 cases
	if(A == null || A.length <=1) return;
	
//Step 1 find 1st break point
	int i = A.length-1-1; //prev index i
	while(i>=0 && A[i] > A[i+1]) i--;


	//if we have found the breakpoint i >=0
	if(i >=0){		
//step 2 //find the next element just greater than A[i] to swap
		int j = A.length - 1;
//keep moving j until a point where nums[j] becomes greater than i
//swapping 3 with 4 in 13542
		while(A[j] <= A[i]) j--;
		swap(A, i, j);
	}
        	reverse(nums, i+1, nums.length-1);

	}
	
	public void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j){
		int temp = arr[j];
		arr[j] = arr[i];
		arr[i] = temp;
	
	}
	
	//Good way to use swaps to reverse..swap ends , increase i , decrease j
	public void reverse(int[] A, int i, int j){
		while(i < j) swap(A, i++,j--);
	}
	
	
	}
}
