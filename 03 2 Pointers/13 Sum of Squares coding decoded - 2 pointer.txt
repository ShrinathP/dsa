//Coding decoded, 2 pointer approach
//cue - 2 pointer between 0  AND  'sqroot of c'


//Standard 2 popinter with total = left^2 + right^2 check

class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = (int)Math.sqrt(c);

        while(left<=right){
            int total = left * left + right *right;
            if(total == c){
                return true;
            } else if (total>c){
                right--;

            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
//Note the answer does not submit for higher values because it wants you to convert everythng to double
//Now you need 'double cur = Math.pow(left, 2) + Math.pow(right, 2) ' to make it correct.
