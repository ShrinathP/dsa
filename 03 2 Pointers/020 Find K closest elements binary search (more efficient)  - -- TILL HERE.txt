//https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/discuss/106426/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Binary-Search-O(log(N-K)-%2B-K)
//Very good explanation
//At any point of time 
//1. We find a mid
//2. Run a binary Search to find the left most part of the window K
// See visualiation in solution
//If distance of x from mid is greater than mid+k

//Time COmplexity O(logN) binary search
// move left
// NOTE == consider x is in the middle of A[mid] and A[mid + k]
//consider hi as length - K as we only need to find the left index
