Digital root problem
Algoritms made easy O(1) solution

If you note the digital root gets repeated after every 9 numbers
eg
digital root of 
6 is same as 15 is same as 24 is same as 33

so for 0 digitalroot = 0
for multiples of 9 it will be 9
for all other cases it will be num % 9

class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if(num == 0) return 0;
        return num % 9 == 0  ? 9: num % 9; 
        
    }
}
